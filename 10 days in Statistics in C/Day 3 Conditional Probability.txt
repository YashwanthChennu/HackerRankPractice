Problem Statement: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-mcq-4/problem

Statement:

We have the sample space like this {BB, BG, GB, GG}
given that one of them is Boy but in the questionit wasnt mentioned that 
the first or second child is boy
So we need to consider the possible occurence like this
1. first child may be boy
2. second child may be boy

so the {BB, BG, GB} satisfy this condition so
the probability will be 1 outcome of all the 3
so the P[E] is 1/3
