Problem Statement: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-mcq-5/problem
solution:

It is stated that we need to draw two cards from same suit
so we can take any card of any suit that means we need to select 
one card out of 52 cards so it is 52/52 = 1
and second card should be of same suit but we have already taken one card 
of that suit so another card will be 1 out of 12 and total outcomes will be
1 out of 51 i.e., 12c1/51c1
so the answer will be 1 * 12/51 i.e, 12/51
