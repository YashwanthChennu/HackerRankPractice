problem statement: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-mcq-6/problem
solution:

It is already given that one out of two marbles drawn is red
then selecting one of the blue marble is 4c1 and the total outcomes will
be 2(red marbles ) + 4 (blue marbles) = 6
so the probability will be 4c1/6c1 = 2/3
the solution will be 2/3
